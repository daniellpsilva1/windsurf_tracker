# Velocity-Based Training Bar Tracker

## Overview
This web application uses TensorFlow.js and computer vision techniques to track bar movement for velocity-based training analysis.

## Features
- Real-time bar tracking using webcam
- Velocity calculation
- Coordinate tracking
- Simple start/stop tracking interface

## Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with camera support
- Stable internet connection

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Allow camera access when prompted

## How to Use
1. Click "Start Tracking" to begin
2. Perform your bar movement
3. Click "Stop Tracking" to end session
4. View results in the tracking results section

## Technical Details
- Frontend: HTML5, JavaScript
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow.js
- Tracking Method: Basic image processing (to be enhanced)

## Limitations
- Requires good lighting conditions
- Currently uses basic detection algorithm
- Works best with high-contrast backgrounds

## Future Improvements
- Advanced machine learning bar detection
- Calibration options
- More precise velocity calculations

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow.js
- TensorFlow.js Visualization library
